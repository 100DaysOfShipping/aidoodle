# AI Doodle Web App Development Plan

## Overview
The AI Doodle Web App is a simple drawing application that allows users to create doodles on a canvas. Users can use basic tools like pencil, eraser, and color selection. Additionally, the app will feature an AI command input that allows users to request specific drawings, which will be processed via an API call.

## Features

### Canvas
- **Basic Drawing Tools**: 
  - Pencil for freehand drawing.
  - Eraser to remove parts of the drawing.
  - Color palette for selecting different colors.

### AI Command Input
- **Text Input**: 
  - Users can enter commands like "draw apple".
  - The app will send the current doodle as a PNG to an API.
  - The API will return an updated image, which will be displayed on the canvas.

### Loading Screen
- **Loading Indicator**: 
  - When an AI command is processing, a loading screen will overlay the canvas.
  - The current image will remain visible beneath the loading indicator.

## Design
- **Style**: 
  - Clean and retro aesthetic.
  - Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Technical Requirements
- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML5 Canvas for drawing.
  - JavaScript for handling user interactions and API calls.
  - CSS for styling the app with a retro look.

- **Backend**: 
  - API to process AI commands and return updated images.

## Development Stages

### Stage 1: Basic Canvas and Drawing Tools
1. **Setup Project Structure**
   - Initialize a new project with necessary files and folders.

2. **Implement Canvas**
   - Create a canvas element with basic drawing tools (pencil, eraser, color palette).

3. **Design and Style**
   - Apply a clean and retro style to the app.

### Stage 2: AI Command Integration
1. **Develop AI Command Feature**
   - Add a text input for AI commands.
   - Implement functionality to capture the current canvas as a PNG.

2. **API Call Implementation**
   - Set up API call to send the current canvas image and receive an updated image.
   - Ensure the response updates the canvas correctly.

3. **Loading Screen**
   - Design and implement a loading overlay for the canvas during API processing.

### Stage 3: Testing, Debugging, and Deployment
1. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Test all features for functionality and fix any bugs.
   - Ensure smooth integration of AI features with the canvas.

2. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the app to a web server for public access.

## Questions
- What specific API will be used for processing AI commands?
- Are there any specific design inspirations or examples for the retro style?
- What is the expected timeline for the project completion?
